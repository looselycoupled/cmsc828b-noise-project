The Partners announced the Sustainability Compact for Bangladesh - a statement of principles and commitments designed to bring about a lasting transformation in the sector .
Today , on the commemoration of the Rana Plaza collapse , we take note of the progress that has been made , but also the urgent work that remains .
Over the past two years , the government of Bangladesh has amended its Labour Law to strengthen certain aspects of freedom of association , collective bargaining and occupational health and safety ; recruited and begun training a significant number of new factory inspectors ; started fire and structural safety assessments and begun posting online factory safety information ; established a hotline to report labor concerns ; and since January 2013 , registered approximately 300 new trade unions .
We urge the government to issue -without further delays- the implementing rules for Bangladesh Labor Act , consistent with international labor standards .
Similarly , we call upon the Government of Bangladesh to enact legislation on economic processing zones that ensures workers inside the zones enjoy rights commensurate with those outside the zones .
Also of pressing concern , the government should respond swiftly to cases of unfair labour practices , violence , and harassment against trade unions and workers " representatives .
We note that advances in health , safety , and labor rights will remain fragile and impermanent if workers are unable to exercise those rights and organise to represent their interests and concerns .
Our commitment to Bangladesh is strong and enduring .

European Parliament agrees negotiating mandate for regulation of financial benchmarks
Strasbourg , 19 May 2015
The European Commission 's proposal to make benchmarks more reliable and less at risk of manipulation moved forward today after the European Parliament cleared the way for negotiations with the Council and the Commission to start next month .
The Commission proposed new standards in September 2013 in the wake of the alleged manipulation of various benchmarks including inter @-@ bank offered rates ( EURIBOR , LIBOR , etc . ) and other benchmarks , such as those for foreign exchange ( FX ) and commodities , including gold , silver , oil and biofuels .
The proposed EU rules aim to improve the functioning and governance of benchmarks that are produced and used in the EU in financial instruments such as bonds , shares , futures or swaps , and in financial contracts such as mortgages .
said Jonathan Hill , EU Commissioner responsible for Financial Stability , Financial Services and Capital Markets Union .
" Our proposal will put in place rules for safer benchmarks across the EU .
I am confident that we can now move swiftly to find an agreement on a final text . "
Background :
A benchmark is an index or indicator calculated from a representative set of data or information that is used to price a financial instrument or financial contract , or to measure the performance of an investment fund .
Examples include the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate ( EURIBOR ) , both benchmarks for inter @-@ bank interest rates ; oil price assessments and stock market indexes .
Benchmarks play a crucial role for consumers as they help determine the mortgage payments of millions of households , while in the financial industry , for example , benchmarks determine the prices of many derivatives .
The Commission first proposed a on benchmarks in September 2013 to improve the functioning and governance of benchmarks produced and used in the EU and to ensure they are not subject to manipulation ( see ) .
The regulation upholds the agreed at international level by the International Organization of Securities Commissions ( IOSCO ) in 2012 and 2013 .
The Council already agreed on a negotiating mandate as regards that proposal in February 2015 ( see ) .
- ensuring the appropriate supervision of critical benchmarks , such as EURIBOR / LIBOR , the failure of which might create risks for many market participants and even for the functioning and integrity of markets of financial stability .
The so @-@ called trialogues between the European Parliament , Council and Commission will start in June .
The Commission hopes to reach a final agreement as soon as possible .

Statement on behalf of the European Commission by Jonathan Hill on the capital controls imposed by the Greek authorities
Brussels , 29 June 2015
The European Commission takes note of temporary restrictions on the free movement of capital which were announced by the Greek authorities on Sunday evening and have now been published in the official gazette .
In accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , Member States may take measures in respect of capital movements which are justified on grounds of public policy or public security .
In accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union , measures may also be introduced for other overriding reasons of general public interest .
Such exceptions to the principle of the free movement of capital must be interpreted very strictly , and be non @-@ discriminatory , as well as suitable and proportionate in light of the objective .
This also means that capital controls must be applied for the shortest possible period .
As guardian of the Treaties and with a view to safeguarding the integrity of the single market , the Commission has made an immediate , preliminary assessment of the Greek measures that introduce the controls and finds them to be , prima facie , justified .
In the current circumstances , the stability of the financial and banking system in Greece constitutes a matter of overriding public interest and public policy that would appear to justify the imposition of temporary restrictions on capital flows .
Maintaining financial stability is the main and immediate challenge for the country .
While the imposed restrictive measures appear necessary and proportionate at this time , the free movement of capital will however need to be reinstated as soon as possible in the interest of the Greek economy , the Eurozone , and the European Union 's single market as a whole .
The Commission will closely monitor the situation and the implementation of the imposed restrictive measures on capital movements .
The Commission stands ready to assist the Greek authorities with the technical aspects of this work .

Brussels , 08 July 2015
" Today 's vote in Parliament establishes a strong and forward @-@ looking political platform as we continue our TTIP negotiations .
That 's my urgent task in the months ahead , and it 's clear from today 's vote that only an ambitious , comprehensive and balanced agreement which demonstrably delivers jobs and growth in Europe will obtain democratic backing .
That is what I am seeking with our US partners .
What today 's vote also signals is that the old system of investor @-@ state dispute settlement should not and cannot be reproduced in TTIP - Parliament 's call today for a " new system " must be heard , and it will be .
I presented to Parliament far @-@ reaching reform ideas in May .
I will now press ahead to flesh these out , and transform them into legal proposals , so that these further reforms can be incorporated into Europe 's proposals for TTIP .
I strongly welcome the democratic debate which has taken place , covering all areas of this key negotiation - it has highlighted the major new opportunities TTIP could deliver for the European economy .
I hope the debate has also clarified some of the things TTIP will not do : TTIP will not in any way affect EU public services , nor will it in any way undermine the power of EU or national Parliaments .
And it will certainly not undercut core EU legislation in areas such as food safety or environmental protection .
These fears are unfounded .

Statement by Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development Neven Mimica following the adoption of the " Addis Ababa Action Agenda " by the Third International Conference on Financing for Development
Addis Ababa , 16 July 2015
The many weeks of discussions with our international partners have borne fruit : today the Third International Conference on Financing for Development has agreed on the " Addis Ababa Action Agenda . "
I welcome this accord , which puts in place very robust foundations to support the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) that will be agreed in September in New York and the climate agreement to be adopted in December in Paris .
I am delighted that together we have been able to decide on an ambitious vision .
It reflects the changed world we live in and addresses the full range of what we call " means of implementation " : the tools , policies and resources that need to be in place to ensure that the future agenda can be implemented .
Today 's agreement acknowledges that all actors have to mobilise all resources to come to a success .
The Sustainable Development Goals cannot be achieved without domestic revenue mobilisation .
Ownership , built on responsibility , accountability and own strength is key .
Putting in place fair and efficient tax systems is a priority and we will need to address challenges such as tax avoidance and illicit financial flows together .
International trade features prominently in today 's agreement as an engine for development and I am proud to say that the EU is already the world 's most open market for developing countries ' exports .
We are also the world 's main donor of aid for trade .
In addition , I am personally delighted to see that women and girls receive particular attention and have a central role across the board of our thinking on the means of implementation .
The true value and strength of the Addis Agenda is its comprehensiveness .
It brings together aid , investment , domestic resources and good policies .
No one element can be singled out and taken as measure of success or failure .
It is only by implementing them all together that we can succeed in our common fight against poverty , inequality and exclusion .
I 'm proud to say that the EU and its Member States were instrumental in building the Addis Ababa Action Agenda .
We will actively work together with all our partners to make it real .

Statement on Greece by the European Commission in liaison with the European Central Bank *
The negotiations of the Memorandum of Understanding on the ground in Athens aimed at agreeing a credible and comprehensive package of reforms .
The IMF provided input into the technical analysis and the design of conditionality for the new ESM programme .
The conditionality will be updated on a quarterly basis , taking into account the progress in reforms achieved over the previous quarter .
It still needs to be approved at political level , ratified by Member States and endorsed by the ESM 's Board of Governors and Board of Directors .
The European Commission , the European Central Bank , the European Stability Mechanism and the International Monetary Fund acknowledge the very good cooperation of the Greek authorities during the review mission , which has made possible this agreement after several months of negotiations .
This reform package will enable Greece to address the remaining imbalances in the economy in order to bring it back on a sustainable growth path , while also addressing in a determined way the social challenges facing the Greek society .
In pursuit of this medium @-@ term goal and taking into account the deterioration in the economic situation , the authorities will accordingly pursue a new fiscal path premised on a primary surplus balance targets of - ¼ , 0.5 , 1 ¾ , and 3.5 percent of GDP in 2015 , 2016 , 2017 and 2018 and beyond , respectively .
The trajectory of the fiscal targets is consistent with expected growth rates of the Greek economy as it recovers from its deepest recorded recession .
Safeguarding financial stability : Greece will immediately take urgently needed steps to tackle the non @-@ performing loan ( NPL ) problem in the banking sector .
The extraordinarily high level of NPLs and the related over @-@ indebtedness of the private sector divert significant resources from more productive uses and prevent the banking sector from providing the necessary credit in support of a recovery of growth .
In addition , a recapitalisation process of banks , to be completed before the end of 2015 , will contribute to a stabilisation of the situation in the banking sector .
This will be accompanied by concomitant measures to strengthen the governance of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund ( HFSF ) and of banks .
Together with other programme policies this is expected to foster a normalisation of the liquidity situation in the banking sector , allowing a concomitant gradual easing of capital controls .
There will be an ambitious privatisation programme , and policies which support investment .
The structural reform package to be enacted is significant , particularly in the area of business environment and competition policies , which are key for unlocking the growth potential of the economy .
A modern State and public administration shall be a key priority of the programme .
Particular attention will be paid to increasing the efficiency of the public sector in the delivery of essential public goods and services .
Measures will be taken to enhance the efficiency of the judicial system , including by implementing the recently adopted new Code of Civil Procedure , and to upgrade the fight against corruption .
Reforms will strengthen the institutional and operational independence of key institutions such as revenue administration and the statistics institute ( ELSTAT ) .
The agreed strategy takes into account the need for social justice and fairness , both across and within generations .
Fiscal constraints have imposed hard choices , and it is therefore important that the burden of adjustment is borne by all parts of society and takes into account the ability to pay .
A fairer society will require that Greece improves the design of its welfare system , so that there is a genuine social safety net which targets scarce resources at those who need it most .
The authorities plan to benefit from available technical assistance from international organisations on measures to provide access to health care for all ( including the uninsured ) and to roll out a basic social safety net in the form of a Guaranteed Minimum Income ( GMI ) .
The Institutions are committed to continue working with the Greek authorities on all aspects of this agreement , including on providing Technical Assistance on a number of reform areas foreseen in the programme .
Compliance with the conditionality of the Memorandum of Understanding will be monitored by the Commission , in liaison with the ECB and together with the IMF , as foreseen in Article 13 ( 7 ) of the ESM Treaty .

Statement on World Humanitarian Day 2015 by European Commissioner Christos Stylianides
Brussels , 19 August 2015
Christos Stylianides , EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management has made the following statement :
" Saving lives should not cost lives .
This is why on World Humanitarian Day we commemorate the brave women and men who died whilst in humanitarian service .
Today , we honour humanitarian workers who continue to risk their lives as they help people who suffer .
Their selfless efforts are an inspiration to us all .
Humanitarian crises are more devastating than ever before with an increase in the number of natural disasters and conflicts .
The needs of victims are real and lives are in danger .
Ongoing conflicts and insecurity hamper the delivery of humanitarian aid .
This prevents millions of people from receiving life @-@ saving assistance .
Unfortunately there 's an alarming trend of increased violence against aid workers and violations of International Humanitarian Law .
In 2014 , over 300 aid workers were attacked , kidnapped or killed . "
The European Union as a whole has provided humanitarian aid for more than 40 years and is , together with its Member States , today the world 's largest donor of humanitarian aid .

And the other Eurozone countries are delivering on their promise of continued solidarity made on the same day .
The message of today 's Eurogroup is loud and clear : on this basis , Greece is and will irreversibly remain a member of the Euro area .

European Commission Statement following the temporary reintroduction of border controls by Germany , particularly at the German @-@ Austrian border
President Jean @-@ Claude Juncker this afternoon spoke on the phone with Chancellor Angela Merkel where she informed him about the temporary reintroduction of controls at the borders with other EU @-@ Member States , particularly at the German @-@ Austrian border .
The temporary reintroduction of border controls between Member States is an exceptional possibility explicitly foreseen in and regulated by the Schengen Borders Code , in case of a crisis situation .
The current situation in Germany , prima facie , appears to be a situation covered by the rules .
The EU institutions have the task to ensure the proportionality of the exceptional measures concerned .
The Commission will closely monitor the situation and keep the European Parliament and the Council fully informed , as foreseen in the Schengen Borders Code .
The objectives of our efforts must be to help ensure that we can go back to the normal Schengen system of open borders between Schengen Member States as soon as feasible .
The German decision of today underlines the urgency to agree on the measures proposed by the European Commission in order to manage the refugee crisis .
As President Juncker said in his : The free movement of people under Schengen is a unique symbol of European integration .
However , the other side of the coin is a better joint management of our external borders and more solidarity in coping with the refugee crisis .
This is why Monday 's extraordinary Council of Interior Ministers is so important .
We need swift progress on the Commission 's proposals now .

European Commission statement on national data retention laws
European Commission statement on national data retention laws
We have seen press reports suggesting that the European Commission is " threatening to take Germany to court " over concerns regarding its national data retention law .
As the European Commission has repeatedly said since the European Court of Justice annulled the EU Data Retention Directive : the decision of whether or not to introduce national data retention laws is a national decision .
The European Commission has no intention to go back on this statement or reopen old discussions .
The European Commission is not ready to play this game .
We have been very clear that the Commission is not coming forward with any new initiatives on Data Retention .
In the absence of EU rules , Member States are free to maintain their current data retention systems or set up new ones , providing of course they comply with basic principles under EU law , such as those contained in the ePrivacy Directive .
We are therefore neither opposing , nor advocating the introduction of national data retention laws .
This is why suggestions that the Commission is considering court action against the German draft data retention law are misleading .
The College of Commissioners is not contemplating such action .

Looking ahead , we count on Member States to swiftly agree on the final measures needed so that measurements of air pollutant emissions used for the delivery of a vehicle 's type approval reflect emissions in real driving conditions and cannot be fooled by deceitful applications .
A new Real Driving Emission ( RDE ) test procedure will be phased in from early 2016 , complementing the current laboratory based testing .
The agreement on this package , in addition to the already adopted RDE test procedures , will allow the EU to have ambitious and robust real driving emissions testing scheme in place .

I welcome today 's vote in the European Parliament giving its green light to frontloading existing EU funds for investment in growth @-@ enhancing projects in Greece .
EU funding can play a vital role in injecting investment directly into the real economy , if targeted wisely and used to its full potential .
Today 's vote will help to ensure that can happen .
It should be seen in a wider context of the reform process undertaken in Greece .
Timely and effective implementation of reforms to modernise Greek public administration and the economy - as agreed under the new stability support programme - is crucial to regain financial stability and , consequently , ensure economic growth and job creation . "
Corina Creţu , Commissioner for Regional Policy , said : "
I 'm very glad that the European Parliament backed our proposals for Greece to fully benefit from the European Structural and Investment Funds .
These measures are exceptional because the situation is exceptional ; they will help successfully implement the 2007 @-@ 2013 programmes while kickstarting investments under the new 2014 @-@ 2020 period .
It is a strong message of European solidarity and now it is up to our Greek partners to do their part and ensure a swift and lasting return to growth . "

This is a positive step which creates the chance for the sale of an important part of the bank and can pave the way for a privatised , viable business to emerge from the sales process .
My services will now take the necessary steps to formalise this agreement in principle in a Commission decision that will be proposed to the College of Commissioners . "
Following intensive negotiations the Commission and German authorities have been able to agree a solution that includes , first , a split of the bank into a holding company taking over most of the guarantee fee payment obligations and an operating subsidiary which will continue the bank 's current operations .
Secondly , the operating subsidiary will subsequently be privatised in an open , transparent and non @-@ discriminatory tender process .
The subsidiary to be sold will be restructured in a way that facilitates a successful sales process in the light of the privatisation .
The proceeds from the sale will be used in the first place to satisfy the German states ' guarantee fee claims .
The Commission will assess the entity resulting from the sales process in a subsequent decision .
Should the sales process fail , the bank will have to cease new business activities and manage the assets with a view of winding them down .
Background
The procedure when HSH Nordbank 's risk shield had to be re @-@ increased from € 7 billion to € 10 billion .
At that time , the Commission temporarily approved the aid but required a new and deeper restructuring of the bank to enable a final approval of the re @-@ increased guarantee .

Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Vytenis Andriukaitis welcomes the political agreement on novel food
New novel food Regulation has been agreed today .
I am delighted with the political agreement reached by the European Parliament and the Council on the novel food proposal .
This agreement is about innovation , new technologies and simplification .
Thanks to a centralised EU authorisation system the procedure for applicants will be simplified and will provide them with greater legal certainty .
This process will be underpinned by independent scientific risk assessment , carried out by the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) , and will enable safe , innovative food to reach consumers faster .
Special provisions are made for food which has never been marketed in the EU , but which has a proven history of safe use in non @-@ EU countries .
This creates a fairer system for traditional foods from non @-@ EU countries and a favourable environment for trade .
Promoting food innovation is an important feature in the agreement .
Under the new system , the company will be given the authorisation to market the food for 5 years , provided it creates innovation that is supported by new scientific data .
I extend my thanks to both the European Parliament and the Council 's Presidency for finding common ground .
This agreement secures the way to bringing down barriers to using innovative technologies and techniques in the food sector , whilst ensuring safety .

Statement by Commission President Jean @-@ Claude Juncker on the passing away of Helmut Schmidt
Statement by Commission President Jean @-@ Claude Juncker on the passing away of Helmut Schmidt
The news of Helmut Schmidt 's death has touched me deeply .
He was a friend who will be sorely missed both by me and by Europe .
For in him we are losing a very special person , a person whose political courage inspired many people .
For almost a century , the history of this continent forged him and made of him a committed European .
Guided by this , he helped shape the history and destiny of Germany and Europe as Federal Chancellor - and it was thanks to him and his close friendship with French President Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing that Franco @-@ German relations were deepened not just on paper but on every level .
Together they established the European Monetary System , so paving the way for the euro .
Helmut Schmidt said of himself that he was no European idealist .
His commitment to Europe , then , is proof that the European endeavour is not a task for lofty idealists but one for European realists .
He strove to bring our continent closer together with a passion equalled by few , in part because he always understood that we must stick together if we wish to play a substantial role on the world stage .
He repeatedly called for a common economic policy , but he was also always aware that commitment to Europe meant there must be give and take - and equally that it sometimes meant telling people truths they did not wish to hear .
Well beyond the end of his term of office as Chancellor , Helmut Schmidt never lost his sense of responsibility , setting a signal example of political honesty , and that uprightness meant his contributions to political debate carried considerable weight .
His impatience - often justified - at the length of time it took Europe to reach a compromise was sometimes a source of discomfort but always valuable in helping to move Europe forward .
Helmut Schmidt was notable for his courage in one respect in particular : the courage to think into the future .
That courage is his message to us never to give up where Europe is concerned .
My thoughts are with all those who were close to him .

Ahead of the occasion of the International Day for the elimination of violence against women , we join our voices to put an end to violence against women and girls .
Frans Timmermans , First Vice @-@ President of the Commission , Federica Mogherini , the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice @-@ President of the Commission , Neven Mimica , Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development , Dimitris Avramopoulos , Commissioner for Migration , Home Affairs and Citizenship , Christos Stylianides , Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management , and Věra Jourová , Commissioner for Justice , Consumers and Gender Equality , made the following statement :
Ahead of the occasion of the International Day for the elimination of violence against women , we join our voices to put an end to violence against women and girls .
This violence constitutes a blatant violation of human rights and gender discrimination that blights every country in Europe and worldwide .
We strongly condemn all forms of violence against women and girls .
The figures are alarming : one in three women in the EU has experienced some form of gender @-@ based violence in their lives .
Too many girls are married or mutilated in childhood within our borders and beyond .
In many countries , over half of murdered women are killed by an intimate partner , a relative or family member , in their own homes .
They are also very vulnerable to all forms of violence in conflict areas and during humanitarian crises .
Combating all forms of violence against women and girls remains a key priority for the Commission , both within and outside EU borders .
We support the EU accession to the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence as a further step to effectively combat violence against women and girls at national and European levels .
We believe that there cannot be sustainable development without women 's empowerment and this cannot be achieved without eliminating all forms of violence against all women and girls .
As from January 2016 , a new Gender Action Plan 2016 @-@ 2020 for EU external relations , endorsed by the Council , will be applied .
Fighting against all forms of violence against women and girls is one of the priority objectives .
The EU continues to fund humanitarian projects that respond to gender @-@ based violence in emergencies and crises .
Today , the Berlaymont building is lit in orange in support of the ' 16 Days of Activism against Gender @-@ Based Violence ' campaign of the UN Secretary General .
The EU is firmly committed to strengthen its efforts in order to make gender @-@ based violence a problem of the past .

Financial benchmarks : Commission welcomes agreement on new rules to prevent manipulation
The European Commission welcomes last night 's agreement between the European Parliament and the Council of the EU on a Regulation of financial benchmarks .
The new rules were first proposed by the Commission in September 2013 in the wake of the alleged manipulation of various benchmarks which were to the clear detriment of consumers and companies throughout the EU .
Following last night 's preliminary political agreement , the EU is setting a leading standard globally .
A benchmark is an index or indicator used to price financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of an investment fund .
Yesterday 's agreement will improve the governance of such benchmarks produced and used in the EU in financial instruments such as bonds , shares , futures and swaps .
The new rules are also directly relevant for consumers as benchmarks determine the level of mortgage payments of millions of households in the EU .
The new rules will reduce the risk of manipulation by ensuring that benchmark providers in the EU have prior authorisation and are subject to proper supervision .
Manipulating benchmarks amounts to stealing from investors and consumers and undermines confidence in markets .
Today 's agreement will help to rebuild confidence in financial markets in the European Union . "
In the financial industry , benchmarks are calculated from a representative set of data or information and determine the prices of many ( highly leveraged ) derivatives .
Examples include : the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate ( EURIBOR ) ( both benchmarks for interbank interest rates ) ; oil price assessments ; and stock market indices .
The proposed regulation will now be subject to a vote by the European Parliament .
Background
The Commission proposed new standards for benchmarks in September 2013 in the wake of the alleged manipulation of various benchmarks including inter @-@ bank offered rates ( EURIBOR , LIBOR , etc . ) , benchmarks for foreign exchange ( FX ) and commodities including gold , silver , oil and biofuels .
The regulation will implement and is in line with the agreed at international level by the International Organization of Securities Commissions ( IOSCO ) in 2012 and 2013 .
The Council agreed on a negotiating mandate for that proposal in February 2015 .
The Regulation will contribute to the accuracy and integrity of benchmarks used in financial instruments and financial contracts by :
- ensuring the appropriate supervision of critical benchmarks , such as EURIBOR / LIBOR , the failure of which might create risks for market participants and for the functioning and integrity of markets .

Meeting of heads of state or government with Turkey - EU @-@ Turkey statement , 29 / 11 / 2015
Meeting of heads of state or government with Turkey - EU @-@ Turkey statement , 29 / 11 / 2015
Today the Leaders of the European Union met in Brussels with their Turkish counterpart .
Turkey has been a candidate since 1999 and negotiating for accession since 2005 .
Turkey and the EU discussed the importance of overcoming the common challenges ahead .
They are committed to carry further their existing ties and solidarity and adopt result @-@ oriented action to prepare their common future .
They are determined to confront and surmount the existing risks and threats in a concerted manner to reinforce the European Project .
Recalling the final declaration of the last G20 in Antalya , as well as the 2249 UNSC resolution , Turkey and the EU reaffirm that the fight against terrorism remains a priority .
For this purpose it was agreed that a structured and more frequent high @-@ level dialogue is essential to explore the vast potential of Turkey @-@ EU relations , which has not been realised fully yet .
In this framework , both sides agreed to have regular Summits twice a year , in an appropriate format .
Regular summits will provide a platform to assess the development of Turkey @-@ EU relations and discuss international issues .
Regular discussions and cooperation on foreign and security policy should be enhanced including on counter @-@ terrorism against the background of serious security challenges notably the rising threat of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations .
In this context , the two sides agreed to have comprehensive regular political dialogue meetings at Ministerial / High Representative / Commissioner level .
These will be in addition to the regular Association Council meetings .
High level dialogues should also be conducted on key thematic issues .
Furthermore , they noted the European Commission 's commitment to complete , in the first quarter of 2016 , the preparatory work for the opening of a number of chapters without prejudice to the position of Member States .
Preparatory work could subsequently begin also on further chapters .
The EU welcomed the commitment by Turkey to accelerate the fulfilment of the Visa Roadmap benchmarks vis @-@ à @-@ vis all participating Member States .
The European Commission will present the second progress report on the implementation by Turkey of the visa liberalisation roadmap by early March 2016 .
Both sides agree that the EU @-@ Turkey readmission agreement will become fully applicable from June 2016 in order for the Commission to be able to present its third progress report in autumn 2016 with a view to completing the visa liberalisation process i.e. the lifting of visa requirements for Turkish citizens in the Schengen zone by October 2016 once the requirements of the Roadmap are met .
The EU will provide immediate and continuous humanitarian assistance in Turkey .
It will also expand significantly its overall financial support .
The need for and nature of this funding will be reviewed in the light of the developing situation .
In this context , they underlined the contribution by Member State and existing EU resettlement schemes and programmes .
Results must be achieved in particular in stemming the influx of irregular migrants .
The EU and Turkey agreed to implement the Joint Action Plan which will bring order into migratory flows and help to stem irregular migration .
As a consequence , both sides will , as agreed and with immediate effect , step up their active cooperation on migrants who are not in need of international protection , preventing travel to Turkey and the EU , ensuring the application of the established bilateral readmission provisions and swiftly returning migrants who are not in need of international protection to their countries of origin .
Equally , they welcomed the intention of Turkey to adopt immediately measures to further improve the socio @-@ economic situation of the Syrians under temporary protection .
Both sides underlined their shared commitment to take decisive and swift action to enhance the fight against criminal smuggling networks .
As stipulated in the European Council Conclusions on Enlargement of December 2014 , Turkey and the EU have been working on the establishment of a High Level Economic Dialogue Mechanism which will contribute to further enhancement of economic relations and create a business platform to bring business circles together .
They agreed to launch it in the first quarter of 2016 .
They agreed to hold the second meeting of this kind in the first quarter of 2016 .
They took note of the launching of preparatory steps for upgrading the Customs Union .
After completion of this preparatory work by both sides , formal negotiations could be launched towards the end of 2016 .
All these elements will have to be taken forward in parallel and monitored closely .
Turkey and the EU are determined to advance together the widespread spectrum of their actual agenda to ensure that this fresh impetus yields concrete results .

The new agreement marks the end of bank secrecy between San Marino and the EU .
As of 2017 , San Marino and EU Member States will automatically exchange information on the financial accounts of one another 's residents .
Pierre Moscovici , Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs , Taxation and Customs , said : "
This agreement between the EU and San Marino is an excellent example of the new norms for global transparency on tax issues .
It reflects San Marino 's determination to implement global tax good governance standards .
Both the EU and San Marino have shown that concrete action can and will be taken in the fight against tax avoidance and tax evasion . "
Under this deal , Member States will receive the names , addresses , tax identification numbers and dates of birth of their residents with accounts in San Marino , as well as other financial and account balance information .
The same will be valid for San Marino in relation to the accounts held by its residents within any of the EU Member States .
This procedure is in line with the new OECD / G20 global standard for the automatic exchange of information .
The enhanced information exchange will help tax authorities to identify tax evaders , while also acting as a deterrent for those that wish to hide income and assets abroad .
It therefore encourages tax compliance .
The final result should be a fairer distribution of the tax burden between citizens .
The EU signed a similar agreement in May this year and in October this year .
Technical negotiations have just been finalised and are at an advanced stage with Monaco .

The EU has a deep and longstanding commitment to multilateralism in trade .
We feel compelled to call upon our WTO Partners to come to the negotiating table in good faith and prepare for the final necessary stretch needed on the limited issues selected for the talks this week .
First , we need a balanced outcome in agriculture dealing with all forms of export support , benefitting all , in particular the most vulnerable developing countries .
The EU , Brazil , Argentina , New Zealand , Paraguay , Peru and Uruguay , later joined by Moldova , Montenegro and Albania , have tabled a joint proposal to comprehensively address distorting practices in the area of export support for agricultural products , be it subsidies , credits , food aid delivery or the operation of state trading enterprises .
We need to take this opportunity to deliver a comprehensive outcome tackling in parallel all forms of export support .
The EU is ready and able to give up its right to use export subsidies but only as part of a comprehensive , balanced deal based on parallelism .
We call on all participants to work together to achieve such a deal .
The second block of decisions on which we need to deliver on this week is centred on the Least Developed Countries ( LDCs ) where we want to see progress on trade preferences on goods and services , rules of origin , and cotton .
There is a worrying lack of compromise texts on the negotiating table ahead of this ministerial conference which hampers the prospects of a deal .
We are also concerned by the deep persisting differences in positions of the WTO members as it comes to the WTO post @-@ Nairobi agenda .
The WTO should keep working on outstanding Doha Development Agenda issues but with new approaches .
But we also need to recognise that global trade has evolved since the Doha round started 14 years ago .
After Nairobi , we need to jointly address many issues which pose major challenges for today 's global trade .
Such issues could include investment , e @-@ commerce and digital trade , regulatory issues affecting goods and services behind the border , better discipline as regards subsidies as well as local content obligations .
We need a clear vision for the years to come .
Some issues such as trade in services , information technology and environmental goods are already being addressed in plurilateral negotiations , which seem a promising way forward also on other issues .
But resulting agreements should be maintained inside the WTO framework and not outside it , and they need to be open for everyone to join .

On this day , all my thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims .
On behalf of the entire European Commission , I would like to reiterate my deepest sympathy and compassion .
As hard as it may be , I would also like to tell them that this tragedy was not in vain .
In the aftermath of the crash , we took immediate action , in order to prevent such a tragedy from happening again .
Let us be honest , the dreadful chain of events that led to the crash shed light on a number of shortcomings in civil aviation .
Safety should never be neglected and for the last year , we have been working very hard to address these shortcomings .
Immediately after the crash , the European Aviation Safety Agency recommended airlines to have two people in the cockpit at all time .
This has now become a common practice in the EU .
Last May , when the French investigators released their preliminary findings , I set up a Task Force to look into them and they have now made 6 safety recommendations .
This was followed by an Action Plan on how to implement them , which is well on @-@ track .
The Commission has for example proposed the creation of a European aeromedical data repository .
It will give aero @-@ medical examiners better access to the past medical history of pilots , and help detect and look after those in need of medical or psychological attention .
Background
The delivery of this Action Plan is ongoing .
In the Strategy , the Commission proposed the creation of a European aeromedical data repository for pilots , in line with the recommendation of the task force .
More actions will follow in the course of 2016 .

Statement by the Commission President Jean @-@ Claude Juncker on the death of Hans @-@ Dietrich Genscher
I am deeply saddened by the news of the death of Hans @-@ Dietrich Genscher .
Both I and Europe will miss him .
For he had devoted his entire political life untiringly to the reconciliation , unity , and well @-@ being of our continent .
We Europeans owe him a great deal .
As Federal Germanys longest @-@ serving foreign minister , few people have done as much to shape the destiny of Europe .
He quickly recognised the opportunities offered by Ostpolitik and dtente , fashioning them to serve his wish for German reunification .
In September 1989 , addressing cheering refugees from the GDR in the German embassy in Prague , he offered a symbol of hope not just for people in the two Germanies but also for the people of eastern Europe and beyond .
It is thanks in part to his efforts that the European Union today numbers 28 members .
For Hans @-@ Dietrich Genscher , as one who had lived through the war , Europe was of inestimable value .
His commitment to the goal of unity was based not only on the desire to draw the lessons from the human catastrophes of Europes wars .
For him , Europe was our only future .
So the crises of the last few years only heightened his passionate belief in Europe .
He rightly reminded us on numerous occasions that in a world where globalisation was forging ever closer ties , Europe would be setting itself against the tide of history if it were to drift apart .
To the very end , Hans @-@ Dietrich Genscher urged us to fight for Europe rather than just asking what it can do for us .
His legacy , then , is to entrust us with the task of continuing to promote the peace and prosperity of Europe .
My thoughts go out to all those who were close to him .

International Roma Day : Statement by First Vice @-@ President Timmermans , Commissioner Thyssen , Commissioner Jourová and Commissioner Creţu
Yet , anti @-@ Gypsyism is still very common worldwide and in Europe .
The exclusion , inequality and discrimination many Roma continue to face , is in strong contradiction with the Union 's core values .
Roma do not have the same access to jobs , education , housing and healthcare .
Forced evictions of Roma continue to cause concern .
Moreover , the fact that Roma children often cannot benefit from the same quality of education as other children , perpetuates their vicious cycle of poverty .
This is why we believe that there is an urgent need for Roma children in particular to get better access to education .
The European institutions and Member States are committed to fighting discrimination and segregation and improving integration of the Roma community .
Although the integration of Roma is primarily the responsibility of Member States , the " Europe 2020 " strategy prioritises actions that favour socio @-@ economic inclusion of Roma people and prevent discrimination .
In this context , under the banner " For Roma , with Roma , " the Commission is undertaking targeted communication activities to fight discrimination and stereotypes against the Roma population .
For the period 2014 @-@ 2020 , the Commission also provides further funding for measures aimed at social inclusion , through Cohesion Policy .
Through their unanimous adoption of the Council Recommendation on Roma in 2013 , Member States also reconfirmed their commitment towards Roma inclusion .
However , more should be done , at national , but also in particular at local level .
Therefore , the European Union continues to support national authorities , but also and most importantly local stakeholders in their work to protect the Roma 's fundamental rights .
As the guardian of the Treaties , the Commission will continue to support and monitor Member States ' anti @-@ discrimination policies to ensure that fundamental rights are respected for all .
Roma are part of our Union and must not be left behind . "

Statement by Commissioners Malmström , Thyssen and Mimica on the 3rd anniversary of the Rana Plaza tragedy
But this is also time to look back at what has already been done in those last three years to improve the situation of Bangladeshi garment workers .
The active engagement of the EU , Bangladesh and other concerned partners has brought tangible progress on the ground .
A number of labour rights are better protected in Bangladesh today than they were two years ago .
The building and workplace safety have also improved .
The opened a dialogue and supported exchanges with stakeholders , including trade unions , employers , buyers and NGOs in the EU , as well as in Bangladesh .
Nevertheless , essential reforms not least as regards the effective respect of trade union rights and promotion of genuine social dialogue are still needed to ensure a better future for Bangladeshi garment industry workers .
In the coming weeks , the EU will publish a third report on the implementation of the Compact , which will provide a detailed overview of achievements and of work that remains to be done .
Close cooperation of all actors is the most effective way forward .
Their commitment has been and will remain key in driving progress .
All need to stay engaged in order to promote decent working conditions for Bangladeshi garment workers .
Our joint work must continue in the long @-@ term .
The EU 's commitment remains unchanged : the EU will remain closely engaged to bring lasting improvements to Bangladesh 's garment industry and ensure that the EU 's open market helps to spur prosperity into the country .
To improve the responsible management of the supply chain in the garment sector is an important issue not just in Bangladesh , but equally in other countries .
In order to discuss what action is needed , which initiatives are already ongoing and whether there would be added value of complementary action at the EU , the Commission will host a high @-@ level conference next week . "
Background
In reaction to the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory in April 2013 , the Government of Bangladesh , the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) , the European Union and the United States launched a joint initiative known as the " Compact for Continuous Improvements in Labour Rights and Factory Safety in the Ready @-@ Made Garment and Knitwear Industry in Bangladesh . "
Given its involvement in the same supply chains and its own efforts to promote sustainable sourcing , Canada decided to join the initiative as of 2016 .
The Compact outlines concrete commitments in respect of labour rights , in particular freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining , as well as structural integrity of factory buildings , occupational safety and health , and promotion of responsible business conduct .
The European Commission has been working closely with the other Compact partners to translate its commitments into tangible improvements .
To this aim , the Commission hosted in October 2014 the first Compact follow @-@ up meeting and released two technical reports , in July 2014 and April 2015 .

Message by President Jean @-@ Claude Juncker to the Jewish community on the occasion of Holocaust Remembrance Day 2016
I never imagined a Rabbi in Marseille would have to tell his Community it might be better to hide the kippa , I never imagined that Jewish schools and Synagogues would have to be guarded , I never imagined a Europe where Jews feel so insecure that immigration to Israel reaches an all @-@ time high .
71 years after the liberation of Auschwitz this is intolerable .
Europe cannot and will not accept this .
Attacks on Jews are attacks on all of us - against our way of living , against tolerance and against our identity .
Today 's Europe has a lot to be proud of but we must never forget where we come from : Europe saw the worst horrors that humans can inflict on each other .
But as Claude Lanzmann once explained , the Hebrew word for honouring the death also means to remember and to recall - and Europe 's responsibility is to remember for the future .
Never again !
This was the solemn promise of our founding fathers when they rebuilt this continent on the debris of WWII and the ashes of the Shoah .
Since those dark days Europe has come a long way : we have enshrined European values , democracy and fundamental rights in our Treaties .
They are the foundation of our Union and our institutions .
These values are not a given , we need to defend them every day - especially in difficult times .
This is a matter of humanity and a historical responsibility .
It is our moral duty to help those who are in need of shelter , who are fleeing from war , dictatorship and religious and political persecution .
At the same time we must counter the dangerous rise of extremism , racism , xenophobia , nationalism and Anti @-@ Semitism .
Our entire society has a duty to prevent Anti @-@ Semitism and we must fight it on every corner - whether on the extreme right or the extreme left or when it is instigated by extreme Islamists .
The European Commission is doing everything in its powers : We recently appointed a coordinator on combating Antisemitism , we ensure that legislation tackling Anti @-@ Semitism - as well as racism and xenophobia more generally - is correctly applied across all Member States .
This includes Holocaust denial which is already prohibited by EU law , but 15 countries still don 't apply it properly .
I want Europe to be a home for all communities .
We are determined : Never again .
Because a Europe of hate is one that we refuse .
Because a Europe without Jews would be no longer Europe .

Statement by Commissioner Thyssen ahead of International Workers ' Day
In Europe , we have all reason to be proud of our social model : The social market economy we practice is a success story .
Today , the EU remains the largest economy and the largest single market in the world while ensuring strong protection and high standards of living for Europeans .
However , as we are confronted with new challenges such as globalisation , ageing societies and changing work patterns , we cannot solely rely on our past achievements .
We need to continue to push for a deeper and fairer internal market , while making sure we safeguard workers ' rights in an ever evolving labour market and society .
This is why the European Commission has launched a number of initiatives , one of the most important being the .
The Commission recently launched this initiative by opening a .
This will be the basis for a broad discussion with social partners , Member States , civil society , the academia and , most importantly , with EU citizens all over Europe , on the social values and rights in today 's context .
Economic growth and social progress need to go hand in hand , and this is why the European Pillar of Social Rights aims at strengthening the social dimension of the European Union , and in particular the euro area .
On the other hand , workers too should be able to adapt to a changing labour market and society , and this is why later this year , we will present our New Skills Agenda .
In the same vein , the European Commission has presented a , promoting equal pay for equal work at the same place .
Also , in collaboration with the ( EU @-@ OSHA ) , the European Commission has launched the , promoting healthy and safe working practices throughout our working lives .
The Commission will soon put a proposal on the table to revise the to improve the protection of workers against the risks of work @-@ related cancers .
International Workers ' Day reminds us that we cannot take the social achievements of Europe for granted .
Together with social partners , employers and workers , we will continue to strive for a European social model that remains fit @-@ for @-@ purpose and serves over 217 million workers across Europe .

Statement by Commissioner Vella welcoming new global agreement to fight illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing
The , adopted and promoted by the United Nations ' Food and Agriculture Organisation , allows countries to keep illegal operators out of their ports and to prevent them from landing illegal catches .
EU Commissioner for Environment , Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Karmenu Vella welcomed the entry into force of the Port State Measures Agreement :
" We now have a powerful instrument that will help fight illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing at European and at global level .
This is a significant improvement to international ocean governance .
IUU fishing is destroying global fish stocks .
IUU fishing is worth up to 10 billion euros a year .
The agreement ensures better control of what happens in ports and is a key tool to prevent IUU fish from entering the market .
It sends a clear message : when it comes to illegal fishing , we will not turn a blind eye .
Ratification is only the first step .
The next is putting this treaty into practice .
We need to make sure that all coastal states around the world , including developing countries , have the means to effectively implement the Port State Measures Agreement .
The fight against illegal fishing has become global and perpetrators will soon have nowhere to hide . "
Background
The Port State Measures Agreement was originally adopted by the ( FAO ) in November 2009 .
These vessels should send prior notifications to enter designated ports and provide port authorities with information , including on the catches they have on board .
The Agreement also calls on countries to deny entry or inspect vessels that have been involved in IUU fishing and to take appropriate actions .
The exchange of information between coastal and flag states will also improve significantly .
Several additional countries are about to ratify the Agreement in the forthcoming months .
29 countries and the EU ( who have signed as one single party ) have formally committed and signed the Agreement to date .

We have signed today an agreement on 50 million support from the EU 's " African Peace Facility " to the Lake Chad Basin Commission Multi @-@ National Joint Task Force ( MNJTF ) in its fight against Boko Haram , as mandated by the African Union Peace and Security Council .
This agreement comes at a time of renewed efforts by the member countries of the Lake Chad Basin Commission ( LCBC ) and Benin to eliminate the threat posed by the Boko Haram terrorist group and create conditions for the rehabilitation of the affected areas and people .
We commend the countries of the region for the progress made over the past months in ensuring a coordinated regional response through the MNJTF .
The agreement we have signed today will further strengthen the regional coordination of the response .
Our support will allow for the construction and maintenance of MNJTF headquarters in Ndjamena as well as of sector Headquarters in Cameroon and Niger .
We will also provide transport and communication assets to the force headquarters , allowing for effective coordination and command of military operations .
These assets , including vehicles , aerial transportation and reconnaissance capacities and a command , control , communication and information system , will put the central command in a position to co @-@ ordinate operations among troop contributing countries in their respective territories .
The scope is to prevent Boko Haram 's ability to move across borders when fighting uncoordinated bilateral operations .
We reiterate our strong mutual engagement to contribute to restore a safe and secure environment to the civilian population in the areas affected by Boko Haram and other terrorist groups .
Boko Haram attacks against the population have severely affected the North @-@ east of Nigeria , Chad , Cameroon and Niger .
More than 13,000 have been killed , 2.5 million people have been internally displaced , and an estimated 250 000 people fled to neighboring countries .
The escalation of violence has disrupted regional agricultural production and unsettled local markets , causing increasing malnutrition .

Statement by the High Representative / Vice @-@ President Federica Mogherini and Commissioner Christos Stylianides on World Humanitarian Day 2016
World Humanitarian Day marks the anniversary of the 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad , Iraq , when 22 humanitarian workers lost their lives , including the UN Special Representative in Iraq , Sergio Vieira de Mello .
HRVP Federica Mogherini and Commissioner Christos Stylianides , made the following statement :
The tragic images of children from Aleppo in Syria sadly show all too clearly the real human suffering of millions of people around the world caught up in humanitarian crises .
As the European Union , just yesterday we reiterated the urgent need for all parties to the conflict to restore the cessation of hostilities , ensure the lifting of all sieges and allow sustained , countrywide humanitarian access to those in need in Syria .
We are in close contact with UN Special Representative Staffan de Mistura to support the efforts to allow humanitarian organisations to provide lifesaving aid and bring a political solution to the conflict .
And today , on World Humanitarian Day , we pay special tribute to and honour all humanitarian workers around the globe who are working to help people in need .
We honour the memory of all those who have sacrificed their lives to save the lives of others .
We honour all those who risk their lives while bringing assistance to victims of wars and natural disasters worldwide .
Nearly 4000 humanitarian workers have become victims of major attacks since records began in 1997 .
Tragically , over one third of them were killed , paying the ultimate price to serve humanity .
We must not forget their sacrifice .
We must strengthen our understanding of and respect for International Humanitarian Law ( IHL ) and the four humanitarian principles : humanity , neutrality , impartiality and independence .
We reaffirm our commitment to defend IHL and these principles which should be the shield of humanitarian workers while they do their job and ensure access to people most in need .
Last year , the European Commission mobilised the largest ever humanitarian aid budget to assist those in the greatest need .
From the victims of the conflicts in Syria and South Sudan , to strengthening our support for education in emergencies , or helping those affected by the " El Nio " extreme weather phenomenon , our help has supported the most vulnerable .
The European Union is proud to be a world leader in humanitarian assistance and to have helped more than 134 million victims of natural and man @-@ made disasters across more than 80 countries in 2015 . "

European Commission - Statement
It marked the beginning of one of the darkest periods in the recent history of our continent , bringing with it the deportation , torture and murder of tens of millions of people under totalitarian regimes .
While the end of World War II marked the defeat of the Nazi regime , many Central and Eastern Europeans continued to suffer under other totalitarian regimes .
This commemoration also helps us to recall lessons learnt from this dark chapter in European history .
Fortunately , the young generations of Europeans today have not experienced life under a totalitarian or authoritarian regime .
However , we must never take our freedoms for granted .
Therefore , the preservation of historical memory and our commitment to democracy , fundamental rights and the rule of law , remain more important than ever .
The memory of Europe 's history should nourish our commitment to stand up for our common values and principles .

Statement by the High Representative / Vice @-@ President Federica Mogherini and Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Christos Stylianides on " an emergency humanitarian initiative for Aleppo "
We call on all parties to the conflict to support and facilitate this initiative .
This initiative , taken in cooperation with the UN , consists of two main elements :
- First , it aims at facilitating the urgent delivery of basic life @-@ saving assistance to civilians in East Aleppo covering medical , water and food needs .
An inter @-@ aid agency convoy stands ready to move from West to East Aleppo drawing on prepositioned stocks made possible also through EU first line response funding .
This convoy can deliver aid to a maximum of 130,000 people .
- Second , in parallel and simultaneously , it aims at ensuring the medical evacuations of wounded and sick from Eastern Aleppo in urgent need of medical care , with a focus on women , children and the elderly .
The EU calls on all parties to urgently provide the necessary authoritisations for aid delivery and for medical evacuations to proceed .
It intends to work intensively in the next hours and days with the parties concerned to make this happen .
The operations should be conducted under the sole responsibility of humanitarian organisations , and according to their modalities that guarantee the impartiality and neutrality of aid operations and the minimum conditions for the safety and protection of relief workers and civilians .
These humanitarian conditions should be those that the international community must work on .
The EU is also asking medical evacuations to be allowed not only for Eastern Aleppo , but for all besieged areas , including the four towns where lives are also at risk due to lack of drugs and medical treatment .
The EU stands ready to facilitate and support the evacuation and referral of patients to the adequate medical facilities in the region and if needed to Europe for specialised medical care not available in the region .
The EU calls on all its partners and all the parties , to unite on this humanitarian initiative for Aleppo for the sake of humanity and the political future of Syria .

Joint statement by Vice @-@ President Dombrovskis and Commissioner Thyssen on the occasion of the ' International day for eradication of poverty'
While all 28 Member States are now recovering from the crisis , poverty and exclusion are still a reality .
Across the EU , 119 million people are at risk of poverty or social exclusion .
Children and young people are those who are affected the most compared to the rest of the population : Poverty affects the lives of 25 million children in Europe .
More jobs and growth are the best drivers of bringing people out of poverty or social exclusion .
This is why this Commission has made this a priority from the beginning , launching the investment plan for Europe and putting a more social Europe at the heart of our agenda .
We have put concrete initiatives on the table and we will continue to do so .
9 million young people have already benefitted from the and we have just topped it up with additional 2 billion to help an additional 2 million .
Through the we are allocating at least 20 % to measures combating poverty and social exclusion and the Commission has put more emphasis on social priorities in the framework of the .
The establishment of a will also contribute to turning our agenda for social fairness into further concrete actions .

Message from Jean @-@ Claude Juncker on the occasion of the 20th anniversary celebrations of the European Voluntary Service
Dear volunteers ,
Ladies and gentlemen ,
This form of learning , via projects open to young people of the most diverse educational backgrounds , provides completely new professional opportunities and important skills going well beyond what textbooks will offer .
For volunteers such as yourselves , thinking beyond borders , tackling problems together and building cultural bridges goes without saying .
However , such nobleness of the heart not only benefits every one of us ; it also benefits Europe as a whole .
Those who help out at a nursery or hospital or with an environmental , sports or social project are not only supporting children , caring for the sick or saving the environment .
Those who work as volunteers are living European values each and every day .
In whatever way young people become involved , it is always more than just something that stands out on your CV .

Statement of First Vice @-@ President Timmermans and Commissioners Thyssen and Jourová on European Equal Pay Day
Ahead of this occasion , First Vice @-@ President Timmermans , Commissioner Thyssen and Commissioner Jourov said :
That is not fair , not sustainable and frankly not acceptable .
But on our labour market , even in the year of 2016 , this is not yet a reality .
For equivalent work , men are on average paid more .
Now that the consultations with our social partners are closed , the Commission will come forward with a proposal for working families in 2017 which will not only help working parents and carers to find the right balance between their private and professional life , but will also increase women 's participation in the labour market .
The Commission will also continue to support Member States ' efforts to combat the gender pay gap on the ground .
So today , on European Equal Pay Day , we take a stand to give women and men the same opportunities on the labour market .
The same pay for the same work in the same place is not only a fundamental European value , our competitiveness will also depend on allowing female talent to flourish so all of us are lifted up . "

We have lost too many friends , neighbours and loved ones in the past year .
We have witnessed too many atrocities .
On this European Day of Remembrance , we express our sympathy and support to those who grieve and bear the physical and psychological scars of terrorist acts .
We also recall our commitment to support the victims and their families , to strengthen their rights , to defend their interests and to ensure their voices are heard .
Terrorists want us to be afraid .
They try to spread hatred and fear , to create intolerance and to turn us against each other .
This mentality has no place in our societies , our lives , and our European Union .
Every one of us must defeat these ideas , defend our fundamental values and rights , and protect our friendships built through diversity and multiculturalism .
Communities must feel safe and nobody should feel isolated or excluded from society : this is our common responsibility .
The European Union continues to work on helping States both within our borders and beyond to prevent further attacks .
Last year , the Commission presented the European Agenda on Security for 2015 @-@ 2020 , which identifies the fight against terrorism as one of its key priorities .
Justice and Home Affairs Ministers advanced yesterday with the revision of EU legislation on firearms and they are expected to agree today on a new Directive on combating terrorism , proposed by the Commission to step up our common response to terrorism .
We are also working against the financing of terrorism and will make legislative proposals in the coming months .
The European Union also has a responsibility beyond its borders , and is committed in its fight against terrorist groups such as Da 'esh , al @-@ Qaeda and Boko Haram , in cooperation with our regional and international partners and in accordance with international law .
Only a political solution in Syria , the establishment of inclusive political governance in Iraq , the formation of a Government of National Accord in Libya , and the creation of conditions for a successful and stable National Unity Government in Afghanistan can really defeat terrorist groups .
The global threat of terrorism is unprecedented .
It is not as individual Member States or even as the European Union alone that we will defeat it .
It is our collective , global commitment .
On this day of remembrance we stand strong and united as we offer our solidarity and support to all victims of terror , in Europe and around the world .
Our unity is our strength .

Draft rule paves the way for EU exports of apples and pears to the US
Statement by EU Health and Food Safety Commissioner Andriukaitis , Trade Commissioner Malmström and Agriculture Commissioner Hogan .
" We welcome the publication by the USDA of the draft rule as a necessary step in the process to facilitate the export of apples and pears from the European Union to the United States .
It is a welcome reflection of the increased level of engagement by the Commission with the US administration .
It will be of significant benefit to European farmers , many of whom lost their main export markets overnight as a result of Russian sanctions imposed in 2014 .
The eventual opening of the US market will not offset the full impact of the sanctions , but it will certainly help the farming community by at least providing another commercial outlet for their produce .
Following this initiative , we are looking forward to the rapid completion of the remaining legal and administrative steps in order to deliver further tangible benefits for the EU fruit producers .
Opening the market for the 2016 harvest i.e. by September 2016 could be feasible , if all parties continue their efforts . "
Background
This request to simplify market access to the US is pending since 2007 .
The application recently became even more relevant , as EU fruit growers were hit hard by the Russian sanctions imposed in 2014 in response to the Ukraine situation .
Poland and Belgium , for example , lost 50 % of their exports overnight .
The Commission has been increasing levels of engagement with the US administration at highest level to solve this problem - an engagement which is now showing concrete results .
On a technical , phytosanitary level the EU and the US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) agreed a specific protocol of measures to be taken by growers and competent authorities in the EU Member States .
The draft rule , which will be published for public consultation , represents the next step .
US apples and pears have access to the EU market in @-@ line with applicable EU rules .
